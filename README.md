## A website downloader

It downloads an entire directory of a url and all is sub directories, accessible via urls. It however does not download a parent directory. For example a url of https://mysite.com/books/economics will only download the https://mysite.com/books/economics entire directory, its images, its stylesheets and will also do same for sub directories at urls at say https://mysite.com/books/economics/mceachern and  https://mysite.com/books/economics/adamsmith but it will not download anything at https://mysite.com/books/maths.
